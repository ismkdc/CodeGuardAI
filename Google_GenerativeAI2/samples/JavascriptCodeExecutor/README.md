Google Gemini Code Generation Demonstration

This is a demonstration of how to utilize the capabilities of Google Gemini for code generation and function calling.
The `Google_GenerativeAI` SDK offers a simple and efficient way to integrate AI-powered features into your projects.

Additionally, this Sample leverages the [JINT](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) JavaScript interpreter, which is
licensed under the BSD 2-Clause License. You can review the specifics in the `LICENSE.md` file of the project.

## Key Features of Google_GenerativeAI SDK:

1. **Effortless Code Integration**: The SDK provides developer-friendly APIs with minimal learning curve, allowing
   faster integration into existing or new projects. Whether building small-scale features or complex workflows, developers
   can integrate the functionality with just a few lines of code, avoiding boilerplate and repetitive tasks.

2. **Function Call Capabilities**: With built-in support for dynamic function invocation, developers can easily
   trigger backend logic or other custom operations without writing extensive glue code. This reduces the time spent
   on handling manual wiring and repetitive validations, increasing productivity and simplifying application logic.
